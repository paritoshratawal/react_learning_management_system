      TypeScript is an Open Source Object Oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft Corporation. TypeScript is a strongly typed language and its first version was introduced in 2012. It is a Strict Super Set of JavaScript, which means anything that is implemented in JavaScript can be implemented using TypeScript along with the choice of adding enhanced features (every existing JavaScript Code is a valid TypeScript Code). As TypeScript code is converted to JavaScript code it makes it easier to integrate into JavaScript projects. It is designed mainly for large Scale projects.
